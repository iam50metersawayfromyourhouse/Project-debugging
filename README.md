\n

The player's tank can fire in a **straight line** either to the enemy tank (*who's position in randomize every time the player moves*)' or to nothing.\n
The player can move in a 7x7 grid and can traverse to the left, right , up, down, or not to change it's traverse\n
The enemy cant fire and cannot change it's position to be inside the player (hopefully)\n
