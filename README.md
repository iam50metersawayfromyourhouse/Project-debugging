# 1. Tank game
Rules:
The player's tank can fire in a **straight line** either to the enemy tank (*who's position randomize every time the player moves*) or to nothing.
The player can move in a 7x7 grid and can traverse to the left, right , up, down, or not to change it's traverse.
The enemy cant fire and cannot change it's position to be inside the player (hopefully).
